        <p>
          Hi! I'm Anthony, a Computer Science senior at the University of
          Southern California and I'm expecting to graduate in Spring 2021! I
          have a strong interest in anything tech related, especially web
          development and UI/UX design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides coding, I also enjoy photography and have a passion for cars
        </p>
        <p>
          In my spare time, I love to play video games, do photography, and play
          with my two dogs, Flynn and Brie
